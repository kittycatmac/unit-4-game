In this game users click the buttons to try and "hit" the power crystal's number. For each round the game tracks the wins and losses which doesn't reset until the page refreshes. This game is mobile responsive. Javascript is used to attach random number values to the buttons and tracks the wins and losses as well.

# To Get Started
Click any of the four crystals to start. The current number for the users' guesses are by "Your crystal score:" keep clicking the crystal buttons to try and match the Power crystal's number. If the number matches the game starts again and a tally is added to the Wins. If the number "busts" the Power crystal's number then the Losses get a count. The wins and losses can be reset with refreshing the page.

Built with: HTML, CSS and Javascript

# Deployment
If this game was deployed on a larger scale it would be nice to see more of interactive design and see different types of crystals named and more of a learing about geology as well as try to "hit" the power crystal's number.
